	<h1>Learn The Basics!</h1>
	
		<p>So, you're new at yoyoing? Here are some things you need to know in order to yoyo successfully. First off there is some basic vocab you're going to need to know.</p>
<center>
		<big>
			<b>Sleeper:</b> A sleeper is when you throw the yoyo down with greater force than you usually would and let the yoyo "sleep" while it spins at the bottom of your string.
		</big>
		<br/>
		<br/>
	<big>
		<b>A breakaway throw:</b> A breakaway throw is when, instead of throwing the yoyo down in front of you, it goes to the side. In order to do that, you put your arm in a "muscle/flexing" position and throw down. You'll know when you've done it right because the yoyo will be spinning sideways.
	</big>	
	</br>
	<h2><font color="darkgreen">Okay, now that you know the very basic vocab, you need to decide what division of yoyoing you are going to enter. There are five divisions, 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, and 5A. This website will be focusing on 1A yoying-String tricks. And, if you dont know what the divisions listed mean, go ahead and google em. Anyways, into the basics. When you throw a yoyo down, you want to have the yoyo in your hand with the string rolling off the top of your yoyo, with your palm facing upwards. Essentially, you're going to want to roll the yoyo off of the top of your hand/palm. </font></h2>
