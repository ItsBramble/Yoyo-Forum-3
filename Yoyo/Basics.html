		So, you're new at yoyoing? Here are some things you need to know in order to yoyo successfully. First off there is some basic vocab you're going to need to know.
		<p>
			<b>Sleeper:</b> A sleeper is when you throw the yoyo down with greater force than you usually would and let the yoyo "sleep" while it spins at the bottom of your string.
		</p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>A breakaway throw:</b> A breakaway throw is when, instead of throwing the yoyo down in front of you, it goes to the side. In order to do that, you put your arm in a "muscle/flexing" position and throw down. You'll know when you've done it right because the yoyo will be spinning sideways.
